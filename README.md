# test_package


To do
-----

## Doc, install and writing code
- Write a doc for the function
- Organize code as a package : folder/code/functions.py, and add an __init__.py file, in which only the version is present.
- At the root, write a setup.py function that will allow to install the package, and then do `pip install -e.`. This should not return any error.
- In the code folder, create a `tests` folder, a `test_linear_regression.py` file in it and write several test functions, with names starting with `test_`. Then, run `pytest` at the root file. All tests should pass
- Check that the code is compatible with pep 8 using the command `flake 8`
- Upload everything on github by first adding all new files using `git add ...`, then commiting by using `git commit -am ` (write a message here) and then `git push`. Check on github that the new code is here.
